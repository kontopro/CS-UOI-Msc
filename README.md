In this thesis, after evaluating the existing signal features, we propose two additional techniques to the diagnosis of CTS; the first one consists of more geometric
characteristics of the signal than those that are applied today and the second one is a
feature which arises from the implementation of an algorithm called Dynamic Time
Warping and examine if it can identify patterns in our time-series data.
Our results show that geometric characteristics in addition to Dynamic Time Warping feature can ameliorate the accuracy of our model to predict the CTS grading
severity and also increase the sensitivity and specificity values of today methods.
